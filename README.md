# Bond Pricing Analytics & Return Predictors
A quantitative analysis project focused on uncovering the key determinants driving U.S. Treasury bond prices using regression-based modeling techniques.

## Objective  
To evaluate which bond-specific factors (e.g., yield, coupon, duration) significantly influence pricing and construct a predictive model for better valuation insights.

## Key Insights  
- Applied OLS regression to identify statistically significant predictors of bond prices  
- Achieved an R² of 0.75 using yield, coupon rate, and duration as core variables  
- Conducted residual and confidence interval analysis to flag pricing anomalies  
- Benchmarked model robustness using out-of-sample performance and diagnostics  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels  
- **Statistical Methods**: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Confidence Intervals, Residual Plots  
- **Data Source**: U.S. Treasury bond dataset (cleaned version provided)

## Business Value  
This project supports fixed-income analysts, traders, and portfolio strategists in interpreting the market drivers behind bond valuation — making regression-based insights actionable for pricing, risk evaluation, and forecasting returns.
